# Solar-panels-2020-2021
MATLAB Coding assessing whether Solar Panel's are worth it on a cost and energy basis. High level - Function(solar panel sizes, panel orientation, sun location and geographic location)

Section I - Defining Variables
This section defines variables. Such as geographic location, nearby
weather station data, solar panel efficiencies, energy demands, and buy/sell prices.

Section II - Assessing the Actual Solar Radiation Data for the Specified Location
This section plots the daily and hourly solar radiation data from the inputted data set. 

Section III - Calculating the relative position of the sun at a specified location as a function of Time
This section calculates the angular position of the sun above the geographical coordinates of the solar panel location for every hour of every day of year X. This is then used to find the angles between the plane of the solar panel and the sun's rays.

Section IV - Calculating energy demand through the year and analysing energy flows.
This section defines the energy demand over a Jan-December. This data is then used to calculate the energy flow to and from the national grid over a year (i.e. in the summer, there is likely a surplus of energy generated and in winter a shortfall). The topic of energy costs and prices is introduced, and the balance sheet is calculated over the year. Energy storage batteries are also introduced to show that hour cost efficiencies can easily be increased.

Section V - Detailed Cost Analysis over the year
This section looks at the money flow over the course of a year. It introduces government bursary schemes as the primary ROI source for solar panels.

Section VI - Detailed Long Term ROI Costing
This section looks at a 30-year cost/income projection of the solar panels.

Section VII - CO2 Long Term Analysis
This section assesses the improvements in CO2 costing.
